# Utiluna — Current Status

## Current state

- UX V2 foundations through the homepage exploration cue are merged on `main`.
- Main uses the generic ToolPage shell, semantic processing/result status metadata, and the registry-based dynamic tool route.
- Published tools are connected to independently loadable implementation modules through the central registry.
- Tool runtime capabilities are scoped per tool; clipboard is currently the only browser capability enforced through the runtime.
- SEO metadata now provides canonical URLs, localized alternates and Open Graph data for tool pages.
- Category pages use the shared localized catalog metadata instead of duplicating French-only labels.
- The platform audit found no current application-level `fetch()`, `XMLHttpRequest`, URL-state, localStorage, sessionStorage or IndexedDB implementation in the published tools.

## Recently completed

- Merged the registry-based dynamic tool route and removed per-tool App Router page duplication.
- Merged tool-scoped runtime capability enforcement for clipboard.
- Added an explicit access axis (`anonymous`, `account`, `premium`) separate from processing classification.
- Merged canonical and localized tool metadata/SEO support.
- Merged the percentage result-panel layout fix so the result column no longer stretches the input column unnecessarily.
- Merged the category-page i18n correction so English routes no longer fall back to hard-coded French UI.

## Platform audit conclusions

### Processing and external services

- The current published catalog is local-only.
- Processing metadata is validated against declared capabilities and providers.
- No current published tool needs an external API or Utiluna server.
- The architecture is ready for external/server tools, but they must explicitly declare network capability, provider metadata and the corresponding processing classification.

### State and sharing

- Current tool state is component-local.
- No published tool currently implements URL state or persistence.
- Do not introduce a generic sharing serializer before a real tool needs shareable state.
- Future shareable state should be explicitly declared by the tool module and must never expose sensitive values accidentally.

### Database boundary

- Do not introduce Supabase/database infrastructure yet.
- Executable behavior and technical capabilities remain authoritative in Git/code.
- A future database may own editable catalog/editorial data, publication state, account data and community data.
- Database-backed metadata must not be allowed to falsely redefine executable tool behavior.

### Catalog, editorial and i18n

- The central catalog/registry is sufficient for the current toolbox.
- The category-page duplication was removed.
- The large centralized editorial switch remains a scalability hotspot: it works today, but it should eventually move toward module-owned or structured editorial content before the catalog becomes large.
- User-facing global UI strings belong in the i18n layer; tool-specific names/descriptions/SEO are structured per locale.

## Not implemented yet

- Supabase/database integration.
- Admin panel.
- Account/premium enforcement.
- Runtime enforcement for browser capabilities beyond clipboard.
- Generic sharing runtime.
- Database-backed catalog/editorial content.
- Large-scale editorial content migration.
- External-service integrations.

## Next actions

1. Finish the remaining tool-platform audit with emphasis on module-owned editorial content and catalog scalability.
2. Define the code/database boundary and schema before introducing Supabase.
3. Introduce persistence or sharing only when a concrete tool requirement justifies the corresponding runtime capability.
4. Continue the UX audit, including the processing-status prominence and above-the-fold tool hierarchy, then apply targeted fixes.
5. Expand runtime capability abstractions only when an actual tool needs the capability.

## Important boundary

The code/module remains authoritative for executable behavior and technical capabilities. Future database/catalog data may control editable product and editorial information, but it must not be allowed to falsely redefine what a module technically does.
